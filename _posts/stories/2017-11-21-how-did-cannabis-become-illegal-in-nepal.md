Cannabis in Nepal has been illegal since 1973, but the region has a long history of use of cannabis as an intoxicant, and continues to produce cannabis illicitly.

Nepal has used psychoactive cannabis for centuries, and as early as the 1700s Nepalese charas was recognized as the best available.


During the 60’s, the Hippie Trail began to route young Western adventurers through Nepal. The stable traditional cannabis economy was rocked by the influx of demand, and the heavy usage by visitors normalized and made trendy cannabis consumption locally.

Until 1973, sales and cultivation of cannabis was widespread – licensed dealers even operated from government approved hashish shops on Kathmandu’s infamous Freak Street.
If not the directive from the US government to make cannabis illegal, Nepal would be the real “AMSTERDAM” of the world which it actually started out to be.

What could be the reason to illegalize the production and sells of cannabis which was actually making contribution to the whole economy of country? Why did US government pressure government of Nepal at that time?

* US government was waging war on drugs at that time.
* Huge amount of hashish was smuggled to the USA
* Cannabis effect the profits to be made from the legal and illegal use of opiates. (It is said that this is also the reason why USA has kept cannabis illegal at the federal level, though cannabis has been legal at some of its states)

In 1973, Nepal canceled the licenses of all cannabis shops, dealers, and farmers, under pressure from the United States and the international community. Nepalese authorities began making arrest of growers, dealers and even buyers. The Freak Street dealers were deported and tourists were issued with regulation on dress and appearances, leading to the decline of the hoppy community and an eventual total ban on cannabis.

It is also said that late King Birendra was offered 40$ million to make cannabis illegal from US government, while USA helping Nepal on its development program with the financial and technical assistance.
